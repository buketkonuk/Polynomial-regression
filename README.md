# Polynomial-regression
Modelling with Polynomial regression techniques

The exchange rate data is the GBP/EUR rate represented against 500 days in time. Objective is to model the rate function for best prediction.

The first method used is to try and approximate the rate as a function by polynomial features in degrees and also apply regularisation techniques of sklearn library such as Ridge and Lasso.

The notebook 'Fundamentals of regression' explains the concepts and shows how to use these methods via sklearn.

BKGBP notebook attempts to apply these methods to the exchange rate data set.
