# Polynomial-regression
Modelling with Polynomial regression techniques

The exchange rate data is the GBP/EUR rate represented against 500 days in time. Objective is to model the rate function for best prediction.

The first method used is to try and approximate the rate as a function by polynomial features in degrees and also apply regularisation techniques of sklearn library such as Ridge and Lasso.
